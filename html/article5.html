    Maya Talpur was 17 years old and lived in a tiny village in Pakistan where talking about mental health was <br>
    taboo when she started struggling. By the time she was finally diagnosed with bipolar disorder, she was 22 <br>
    and it was affecting her education, work and relationships.</p>
    <p>“I get mad insomnia, I can’t sleep because I have so much energy,” said Talpur, who is a 30-year-old artist <br>
    living in Austin. “I’m super high-powered. It’s like someone putting extra batteries in you and you’re running on full power.”
   </p>
   <p>Talpur is a painter who creates abstract art that explains her thoughts, experiences and feelings on a canvas. <br>
    Her paintings are a mix of acrylics on a blank canvas sheet or are textured. 
 </p>
 <p>Talpur said that she always carries her paints and a notebook with her, and she has a habit of fixing her artwork <br>
    every time she sees them hanging on her friends’ walls. She immediately pulls them down, and starts to find and fix <br>
    that missing detail in that painting.</p>
   <p>“At that time, mania was a blessing and a curse to me. I was an insomniac and felt like I had a superpower and was<br>
     invincible,” Talpur said. “I would spend my salary on all the things I didn’t need and then used to cry in the end with <br>
     a Louis Vuitton scarf around my neck during my depressive episode.”</p>
     <p>According to Werchan, mania is considered good by many people, because they have more energy,<br>
         and it enables them to work more than normal people. That is why they don’t go to the psychiatrist<br>
          or seek treatment because they don’t want their mania to heal.</p>
          <p>“Some people get the wrong perception of mania and think that mania is good, because they have more <br>
            energy than others, and they don’t want that to be taken away,” Werchan said. </p>
            <p>According to Talpur, bipolar disorder causes a lot of unpredictability. She can feel neutral today,<br>
                 and tomorrow she could go into her depressive or manic episode. She doesn’t know what uncontrollable <br>
                 effect of the outside world could trigger her mania or depression.
            </p>
            <p>“I don’t have a neutral functional daily life every day, and that’s what affects the most in my daily chores,”<br>
                 Talpur said.<br>
                 “If I’m feeling neutral, and then suddenly I’m depressed, I have to cancel all the plans I made when I was<br>
                  OK because
                  I wouldn’t have the energy to carry out the plans if I’m depressed.”</p>
                  <p>
                    Talpur said she creates a lot of paintings at once during a manic phase and abandons them when she is depressed.<br>
                     All of her art is under construction. She either gets back to them after some time, or her art <br>
                     and feelings stay hidden between her canvas stacks.
