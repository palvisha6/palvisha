        <p>WikiRacer is a simple and fun iOS game based on the popular Wiki game. In this game, the player<br>
             is given a beginning and target Wiki article. They start off on the beginning article and try to <br>
             navigate to the target one in the fastest time or least amount of referential links possible. Our team<br>
              will further gamify this app by supporting features like both single and multiplayer mode as well as an<br>
               in-app racer character whom you can customize and design using points won in games.

        <p>For single player mode, the game can be played by an individual in a time trial environment where they can<br>
             race against their own previous records and try to make it on a global leaderboard for specific topic pairings.<br>
              The player would have the option to play a random game or choose their own Wiki article topics.
        </p>
        <p>However, WikiRacerâ€™s main attraction is multiplayer mode! Multiplayer offers two different selections: <br>
            joining a random game or creating a game. Joining a random game will pair the user with other players and <br>
            start a game. On the other hand, creating a game allows the user to have an invite code for friends to join<br>
             and the host of the game has the option to choose a random game or to pre-select the topics. 
        </p>
        <p>If having a super fun game to play is not enough, WikiRacer has in-game points you can use to customize your <br>
            personal racer character. The game offers a store with different accessories and backgrounds that are available<br>
             to redeem for your character. There is also a character inventory feature, where you can pick and choose from <br>
             the different accessories and backgrounds you have for your character to show off to others.
